# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python


This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players alternate in marking X and O on the board. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The game is implemented using a command-line interface, where the user inputs the row and column of the cell they want to mark.
