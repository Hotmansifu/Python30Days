# Audio Speedup Scrip

This Python script allows you to speed up audio files using the pydub library. It prompts the user to enter the name of the input audio file, the desired playback speed, and the name of the output audio file. It then uses the speedup() function to speed up the audio by the desired amount and exports the modified audio to the specified output file.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Python 3.x is installed on your computer
*pydub library (install with pip install pydub)

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the script with `python audio_speedup.py`
4. Enter the name of the input audio file when prompted.
5.  Enter the desired playback speed (as a float) when prompted.
6. Enter the name of the output audio file when prompted.
