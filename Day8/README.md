# Hangman Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Hangman using Python. In this game, the player must guess a random word from a list of words, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. A random word will be chosen from the list of words, and displayed as underscores to represent each letter.
3. The player must guess a letter by typing it into the terminal and hitting Enter. The player can only guess one letter at a time.
4. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will replace the corresponding underscore(s).
5. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the "hangman" figure will be drawn. The player will have a limited number of incorrect guesses before losing the game.
6. The game ends when either the player correctly guesses the entire word, or the "hangman" figure is completed.
## Customization
You can customize this game by modifying the words list to include your own words, or by changing the max_guesses variable to adjust the difficulty level.

## Have fun playing!
