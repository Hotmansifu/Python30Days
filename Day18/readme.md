# Calculator using tkinter


This is a simple calculator built using tkinter in Python. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.



* Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C x 9/5) + 32

* Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) x 5/9

The program then calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice and displays the converted temperature to the console with two decimal places using the format() method.


## How to use
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the dependencies using the command pip install tkinter.
3. Run the code in your favorite IDE or through the terminal using the command ```python calculator.py```
4. Use the buttons on the calculator to perform arithmetic operations.



To run the program, navigate to the directory where the temperature_converter.py file is located and run the following command in the terminal:

```python temperature_converter.py```
The program will then prompt the user to enter the temperature they want to convert and which conversion they want to make. The input temperature should be entered as an integer, followed by either "F" for Fahrenheit or "C" for Celsius. For example, to convert 32 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, the user should enter:
`32f `
The program will then display the converted temperature to the console.


## Features
* The calculator has a simple user interface with number buttons and arithmetic operation buttons.
* The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* The calculator can clear the display and show the result of the operation.
* The calculator shows an error message if the user enters an invalid arithmetic expression.
