# File Management System

This is a simple file management system that allows users to create, open, save, and save files with new names.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Create a new file: Users can create a new file by entering a name for the file. If the file already exists, an error message will be displayed. If the file is created successfully, the user will be notified.

* Open an existing file: Users can open an existing file by entering its name. If the file does not exist, an error message will be displayed. If the file exists, its contents will be displayed.
* Save the current file: Users can save the contents of the current file. If no file is currently open, an error message will be displayed. If the file is saved successfully, the user will be notified.
* Save the current file as a new file: Users can save the contents of the current file with a new name. If a file with the new name already exists, an error message will be displayed. If the file is saved successfully, the user will be notified.
* Quit the program: Users can quit the program at any time by selecting this option.

## Usage
