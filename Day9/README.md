## Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder
- This Python program allows you to encode and decode messages using a simple Caesar Cipher method. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

## Usage
To use the program, simply run the Main.py script using Python 3. You will be prompted to enter the message you want to encode or decode, as well as the key value (a number between 1 and 25) for the Caesar Cipher.

``` python3 main.py```
- Enter the message to encode or decode: Hello, world!
- Enter the key value (1-25): 7
- Enter 'E' to encode the message, 'D' to decode the message: E
- Encoded message: Olssv, dvysk!```

- In the example above, we entered the message "Hello, world!" and the key value of 7 to encode the message. The resulting encoded message is "Olssv, dvysk!".


Note that the key value must be a number between 1 and 25. If you enter a value outside this range or a non-numeric value, the program will display an error message and prompt you to enter the key value again.
